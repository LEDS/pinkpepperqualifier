Determination of the productive quality of Aroeira fruits (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi) using Computational Intelligence.

Three neural networks were used to classify the ripening stages of fruits. The value 3 was assigned to green, 1 to ripening, and 2 to ripe. These values are present in the mask generated after the model makes predictions.

Four functions were developed within the print_max_predictions function located in the ImageTreatments.py file. These functions aim to process the output of the AI, which is a list containing 4 values representing the probability of belonging to groups 0, 1, 2, 3. The highest value among these 4 is considered the predominant value.

Subsequently, the values generated by the print_max_predictions function are used in the ContaFrutos function to determine the number of fruits in the image. Then, the saida_contagem function is used to store these values in a JSON file.

To test the code, the main.py function is used. Initially, the desired model needs to be defined; the options are MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, and Unet. Inside the model.load_weights() function, the desired model available in the models folder should be loaded. After defining the model, a photo in the format 224x224 must be selected. Upon running the code, a .json file containing the fruit count will be generated.
